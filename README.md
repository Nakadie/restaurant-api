This is my adaptation of the Restaurant API

To run the api choose and run the object [httpresponse](https://github.com/Nakadie/restaurant-api/blob/34cf27701d6aa9fb45ccab6d53f7b7187945db54/src/main/scala/httpresponse.scala) in src/main/scala/httpresponse.scala

You will need a way to send and receive http requests. I recommend using [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download).

There are 6 total commands, and they are listed with examples in this file [src/main/scala/paths](https://github.com/Nakadie/restaurant-api/blob/34cf27701d6aa9fb45ccab6d53f7b7187945db54/src/main/scala/paths)
